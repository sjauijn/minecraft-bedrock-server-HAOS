## What's different from the original

This fork moves the `worlds` directory from the internal `/data/worlds/` to `/addon_configs/mc_server_ha/worlds/`, making world saves accessible via SFTP without needing Portainer or Docker console access.

| | Original | This fork |
|---|---|---|
| `worlds` location | `/data/worlds/` | `/addon_configs/mc_server_ha/worlds/` |
| Accessible via SFTP | ❌ | ✅ |
| Other data files | `/data/` | `/data/` (unchanged) |

**Migration**: On first start, if you already have worlds in `/data/worlds/`, they will be automatically moved to the new location.
